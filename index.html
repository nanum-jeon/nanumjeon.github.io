        <p> Nanum Jeon is a Ph.D. Candidate of <a href="https://soc.ucla.edu/">Sociology</a> and an M.S. Student of <a href="http://statistics.ucla.edu/">Statistics</a> at UCLA, specializing in social stratification and gender inequality. Her research interests include (1) how disruptive events, such as job loss, influence individuals, paying close attention to the effects on both their labor market and family outcomes; (2) how social conditions, particularly cultural norms and the division of household labor, shape gender inequality; and (3) causal inference, quantitative and computational methods. </p>

          <li> Jeon, N., Brand, J. E. The impact of college degrees in reducing COVID-era labor market racial disparities. <a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('covid');"> [Abstract]</a>
<div id="covid" style="display:none;"> <br> The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on employment conditions exacerbated existing racial disparities in the U.S. labor market. However, some of these disparities may have been mitigated for college-educated workers, because black and white college graduates are more likely to have stable jobs, and jobs that enabled them to work remotely, thereby reducing economic and health risks. College degrees could have been particularly protective for black workers during the pandemic, who would otherwise have been more adversely affected by the COVID-19 crisis. In this study, we investigate the effects of college completion by race on job loss during COVID-19. Using panel data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997 Cohort, including the recent COVID supplement, our study conducts causal mediation analysis to decompose the total effects of four-year college completion into the direct and indirect effects through employment in high-skilled occupations. Our findings suggest that the effects of college completion differ substantially between black and white workers. The returns to college degrees for whites, especially those who do not have high-skilled jobs, were limited. In contrast, blacks saw large benefits of completing college on labor market outcomes during COVID-19, even when they did not hold high-skilled occupations. Our findings indicate that racial disparities in job loss during COVID-19 were largely concentrated among less educated workers. </div> &nbsp;</li>
